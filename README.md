# EP_CppWithTermux
###### The initials EP in any repository stand for Educational Project. These are course projects and personal experiments for learning.  

Sometimes I use this repository to learn c++ and computer graphics while traveling, I use Termux, a Linux console emulator for android and the GCC compiler. With it I program on the road!
